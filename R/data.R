#' Geo-referenced California wildfire records from 2011 through 2015
#'
#' A dataframe containing Calfornia wildfire records at the county level.
#' It is created from the Kaggle US wildfire records data by filtering on
#' the date (2011- 2015), state (CA), and key cols and cleaning up the
#' missing counties and reformatting the dates.
#'
#' This data publication contains a spatial database of wildfires that
#' occurred in the United States from 1992 to 2015.

#' Air quality data records for California from 2011 through 2015
#'
#' A dataframe containing Calfornia air quality records at the county level.
#' It is created from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS) API by fetching the
#' AQI along with other atmospheric measurements like CO, Ozone, NO2, PM2.5,
#' and PM10 and reforrmatting the tibble as a tidy data consisting of a row
#' per county per day.
#'
#' AQS contains ambient air sample data collected by state, local, tribal, and
#' federal air pollution control agencies from thousands of monitors around the nation.

#' Daily weather summaries for California from 2011 through 2015
#'
#' A dataframe containing daily weather summaries for California at the county level.

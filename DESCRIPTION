Description: Fetches data from three disparate data sources and allows user to perform analyses on them. It offers two core components: 1. A robust data retrieval and preparation infrastructure for wildfire, climate, and air quality index data and 2. A simple, informative, and interactive visualizations of the aforementioned datasets for California counties from 2011 through 2015. The sources of data are: wildfire data from Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/188-million-us-wildfires>, climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token>, and air quality data from the Environmental Protection Agency <https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html>.
